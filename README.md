# LeagueRankings

This project is to show the usage of Generisc in java.
I have a Standings class that lists sport teams in the order of their ranking (based on wins, losses, and ties)
The type parameter for the standings class is set to extend Teams, therefore only teams of the same type can be added to a list.
I have the league rankings for the NBA in the 2020-2021 displayed and a small start to the NFL league rankings.
